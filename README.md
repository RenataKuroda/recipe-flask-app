#### **Final Considerations**
I really enjoyed working on this project. Having little sleep to be able to manage full time work with this was not a problem because I was having fun! it was interesting to see how much I have learnt in only 3 months.

I After only 2 days working on the project I have achieved a MVP. After that I was working to make the application better.

I still have little extra bits of info I want to include for each recipe and, as the database grows, I want to see extra features as filters and categories. But for now, I'm very happy with my result.
